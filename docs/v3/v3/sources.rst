The official onetap documentation was never seen by any of the authors 
and therefore this documentation is prune to have mistakes (and is unavailable now anyway).

Javascript globals/runtime
---------------------------

The javascript globals were dumped using 
`a script <https://github.com/Le0Developer/onetap-js/blob/master/scripts/dump_globals.coffee>`_ 
and documented with the help of a lot of sample scripts.

The `onetap typescript <https://github.com/marwuint/onetap-ts>`_ 
project contained a 
`javascript runtime dump <https://github.com/marwuint/onetap-ts/blob/f42719ece1668ad0359f3c12b280001f1b1430ad/files/ot.d.ts>`_
and helped us with serious misunderstandings regarding the :js:mod:`Entity` and :js:mod:`Ragebot` modules 
and with fixing a lot of smaller inaccuracies.

Callbacks
----------

All callbacks were directly taken from a collection of sample scripts.
They may be incomplete.
