The official onetap documentation was never seen by any of the authors 
and therefore this documentation is prune to have mistakes.


Javascript globals/runtime
--------------------------

The javascript globals were dumped using 
`a script <https://github.com/le0developer/onetap-js/blob/maater/scripts/dump_globals.coffee>`_ 
and documented with the help of a lot of sample scripts.

The `onetap typescript <https://github.com/marwuint/onetap-ts>`_ 
project contained a 
`javascript runtime dump <https://github.com/marwuint/onetap-ts/blob/master/files/ot.d.ts>`_
and helped us with serious misunderstandings regarding the :js:mod:`Entity` and :js:mod:`Ragebot` modules 
and a lot of smaller inaccuracies.

Callbacks
---------

All callbacks were directly taken from a collection of sample scripts.
They may be incomplete.
